                        <h2>Handoffs and Creativity </h2>
                        <p>Past research on idea implementation has focused on employees trying to win social support for their own ideas, but employees are often handed ideas to implement that were developed by others. We propose and test hypotheses on such handoffs, focusing on how handing employees relatively mature ideas to implement may lead them to build less creative final products. We tested our hypotheses using two studies: an archival study of 5,676 movies in the U.S. film industry and an experiment. Results suggest that late handoffs yielded less creative final products than no or early handoffs, meaning it was costly to creativity when employees implemented relatively mature ideas without driving at least some of their prior development. However, serialized late handoffs—late handoffs received after an earlier handoff between two other individuals—were less costly to creativity than late handoffs from one other individual. The experiment results suggest that the negative effect of late handoffs on creativity was mediated by psychological ownership and product coherence: late handoffs undermined implementers’ sense of psychological ownership and the coherence of their emerging products, reducing the creativity of their final products.</p>
